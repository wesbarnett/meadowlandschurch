# Meadowlands Church

**Lyndhurst, NJ**

After two years of meeting, we've decided to pause our gatherings indefinitely. We thank everyone who visited and contributed to this effort. But, due to a variety circumstances, we've decided not to continue for the time being. We encourage everyone to find a local gathering of Christians in their area. You can still contact us by emailing at any email address with our domain name.
